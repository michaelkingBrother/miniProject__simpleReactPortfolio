> In this final lab, you are going to create a portfolio page for yourself. You will be using the skills you have learned in this course to create a page that showcases your work. The portfolio page will be a single page that will contain the following sections:

> - A header with external links to social media accounts and internal links to other sections of the page
> - A landing section with an avatar picture and a short bio
> - A section to display your featured projects as cards in a grid fashion
> - A contact me section with a form to allow visitors to contact you

> Here you will have the opportunity to use some popular open source libraries that will help you to have a more polished and professional looking page.
